## Run this project

In order to run this project, you just need to create an HTTP(S) server that serves its files and uses the file `index.html` as the main page. [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) is a good option that works right out of the box, but any other simple HTTP(S) server works for the purpose.
